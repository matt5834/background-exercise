# background-exercise
This an exercise that takes the user through a series of Noteflight challenges. 

It was created using an application called [Hype](http://tumult.com/hype/pro/)

## To be developed: 
- Launch as an LTI Tool from within Canvas
- When the user completes the last exercise a grade or module-completed status can be passed back to Canvas. 

## To launch, the index.html file needs to be in the same place as the background_part.hyperesources folder

The background_part.hype file is only for launching the original program that created this webpage:  Hype Tumult
